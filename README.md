# EQBank (Canada) Firefly III Scraper (Chrome Extension)

## Status
This project is a work in progress

## Special Note
EQBank appears to be [investing in open banking technology](
https://eqbank.investorroom.com/2022-07-14-EQ-Bank-partners-with-Flinks-to-deliver-on-open-banking
).

With that in mind, it will probably make sense to use their API directly in the
near future. Rather than using a chrome extension.

I am building this Chrome Extension as a way of vetting the [base project](
https://github.com/bradsk88/firefly-iii-chrome-extension-base
) and making sure it's easy to use for other banks.

## Purpose
This Chrome Extension is used for importing account and transaction data from
EQBank into an instance of Firefly III.

## Extension Project
This Chrome Extension is part of a larger project of Chrome Extensions to get
data in to Firefly III when banks don't want to help with that.
